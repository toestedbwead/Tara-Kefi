**Tara, Kefi** is a whimsical Android mobile app that lets you order coffee, tea, hot chocolate, pastries and snacks from a fictional cat café — where the staff are actual cats with hilarious job titles and personalities!

Choose your favorite feline server, build your order, view your cart, and get a cute receipt featuring your selected cat "serving" you. Perfect demonstration of basic Android UI, navigation, cart logic, and playful theming.

Built ~10 months ago as a fun personal / academic project.
